Hi, I'm Beckett!

I'm a mechanical engineering student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I’m also a FIRST Robotics alumnus of team 6925 (W.A. Robotics). I’m interested in robotics, Formula 1, chess, puzzle hunting, rock climbing, and reading. I’m currently working on learning C++ for embedded computing and chess programming.

Please take a look at my resume [here.](beckettrgordon.github.io/resume_2024.pdf)
