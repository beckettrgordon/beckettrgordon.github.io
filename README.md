Hi! I'm Beckett Gordon, a Mechanical Engineering student at Georgia Tech.

I'm a FIRST Robotics alumnus. I was a member of team 6925 (W.A. Robotics), and the co-captain of the team my senior year of high school. I'm interested in robotics, Formula 1, chess, puzzle hunting, rock climbing, and reading. I'm currently working on learning C++ for embedded computing and chess programming.
